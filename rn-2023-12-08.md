### `array_union_agg`

#### Description

Returns an array that contains the [multiset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiset) union of input arrays.

`array_union_agg` is an aggregate function that combines input arrays into a single output array. The output array is the [multiset union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiset) of the input arrays. The multiset union differs from the standard set union in that it allows duplicates: If any of the input arrays contain duplicates, the output array will also contain duplicates. The number of times an element appears in the output array equals the maximum number of times it appears in individual input arrays.

This function ignores NULL values for input arrays inside the column as well as NULL values inside input arrays. If the column contains only NULL values or there are no rows, the function returns an empty array. The ordering of output arrays is nondeterministic.

#### Return type

array

#### Domain

This is an aggregate function (aggregates rows over a group in [aggregate verbs](../aggregate-verbs.md).)

This is a window function (calculates over a group of multiple input rows using [windowing](window.md).)

#### Categories

  * [Aggregate](../aggregate-functions.md)
  * [Semistructured](../semistructured-functions.md)
  * [Window](../window-functions.md)

#### Usage

```text
array_union_agg( arr )
```

| Argument | Type | Required | Multiple | Constant |
| -------- | ---- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| arr | array | Required | Only one |  Variable


#### Examples
```text
statsby aua:array_union_agg(arr), group_by(X)
```

Assume that you have the following schema and log rows:

| year | X | arr                     |
-------|---|-------------------------|
| 1991 | a | [ 0, 0, 1, 2]           |
| 1992 | b | [ 0, 0, 1, 2, 3]        |
| 1993 | c | NULL                    |
| 1994 | a | [ 0, 4]                 |
| 1995 | b | [ 0, 0, 0, NULL]        |


Calculate the multiset union on `arr` grouping on `X`:

| X | aua                     |
|---|-------------------------|
| a | [ 0, 0, 1, 2, 4]        |
| b | [ 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 3]     |
| c | []                      |

In this example, the output array associated with `X` value `a` contains values `0, 1, 2, 4`. This is because these values appear in the input arrays in the `a` group (years `1991` and `1994`). Value `0` appears twice because it appears twice in at least one input array from the `a` group (year `1994`). Similarly, `0` appears three times in the output array for the `b` group as it appears a maximal 3 times in the input arrays for `b` group (year 1995). As the only input array for `c` group is a `NULL` array, the output array for `c` group is an empty array. Furthermore, the `NULL` value inside the row from year 1995 is ignored and does not appear in the output array for `b` group.

Note that ordering within the output arrays is not guaranteed through multiset semantics. However, it is possible to achieve sorted arrays in the output by composing with `array_sort`:

`statsby aua:array_sort(array_union_agg(arr)), group_by(X)`
